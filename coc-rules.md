<p id="chat-rules"><span class="prompt">miaowware $</span> Rules for Chat Platforms</p>

Try to stay on topic.
The occasional off-topic conversation is fine, but we will not tolerate spam and shitposting.

The [MiaowWare Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct) (CoC) applies in all MiaowWare chat rooms.

The following all apply in their entirety on their respective platforms:

- [Libera.Chat Network Policies](https://libera.chat/policies)
- [Discord Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)
- [Discord Terms of Service (ToS)](https://discord.com/terms)

<p id="code-of-conduct"><span class="prompt">miaowware $</span> MiaowWare Code of Conduct</p>

MiaowWare is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all MiaowWare spaces, including the MiaowWare GitHub organisation, MiaowWare Discord guild, the #miaowware IRC channel and namespace on LiberaChat, and any other MiaowWare space, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the MiaowWare developers (classabbyamp and 0x5c).

Some MiaowWare spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

Harassment includes:

- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.
- Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
- Deliberate misgendering or use of 'dead' or rejected names.
- Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they're not appropriate.
- Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like "\*hug\*" or "\*backrub\*") without consent or after a request to stop.
- Threats of violence.
- Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
- Deliberate intimidation.
- Stalking or following.
- Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
- Sustained disruption of discussion.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.
- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
- Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
- Publication of non-harassing private communication.

MiaowWare prioritizes marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort. The MiaowWare developers will not to act on complaints regarding:

- 'Reverse' -isms, including 'reverse racism', 'reverse sexism', and 'cisphobia'.
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone", "go away", or "I'm not discussing this with you".
- Communicating in a 'tone' you don't find congenial.
- Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions.

Also, please:

- Avoid using overtly sexual aliases or other nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
- Be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
- Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.

## Reporting

If you are being harassed by a member of the MiaowWare community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the MiaowWare developers at [abuse@miaow.io](mailto:abuse@miaow.io). If the person who is harassing you is a MiaowWare developer, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.

This code of conduct applies to MiaowWare spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of the MiaowWare community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by MiaowWare community members, especially MiaowWare developers, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from the MiaowWare community based on their past behavior, including behavior outside MiaowWare spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the MiaowWare community.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of MiaowWare community members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the MiaowWare developers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all MiaowWare spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other MiaowWare community members or the general public.
